   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to PyQEntangle's documentation!
=======================================

This is the PyQEntangle project, which provides routine to perform Schmidt decomposition
for quantum entangled states. The states have to be bipartite, i.e., containing two
subsystems. The two subsystems can be either discrete or continuous.

Note: the releases 2.x is incompatible with releases 1.x and 3.x; the releases 3.x is incompatible
with releases 1.x and 2.x.

This package runs in Python 3.6, and 3.7. However, under Python 3.7, Cython has to be installed.
